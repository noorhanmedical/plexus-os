Build a React + Vite app in this Replit project (frontend only) for an EMR-style dashboard.

I already have a Google Apps Script Web App API working (API key protected). You must wire the app to it.

REQUIREMENTS

1) App shell + navigation
- Left sidebar with tabs: Calendar, Patient Profile, Billing, Finance
- Main content area
- Minimal clean styling (Tailwind if already configured, otherwise simple CSS)

2) API integration
Create a single file in client/src called api.js with:
- export const API_URL = "PASTE_HERE"
- export const API_KEY = "PASTE_HERE"
- export async function apiGet(action, params)
- export async function apiPost(action, payload)
All requests must include header x-api-key: API_KEY.
GET uses query params ?action=...
POST sends JSON { action, ...payload }
If response.ok is false, show a visible error in the UI.

Endpoints:
GET:
- patients.search (query, limit)
- patients.get (patient_uuid)
- prescreen.list (status optional, limit)
POST:
- prescreen.get (prescreen_id OR patient_uuid+requested_ancillary_code)
- prescreen.create (patient_uuid, requested_ancillary_code)
- prescreen.update (prescreen_id, updates: { scheduled_datetime, assigned_staff, location, notes, prescreen_status, cleared_by, eligibility_reason, eligible_after_date, eligibility_status })
- prescreen.updateStatus (prescreen_id, status)

3) CALENDAR TAB (MAIN FEATURE)
Calendar is NOT time blocks. It is a “Daily Prescreen Roster” for a selected date (default today).

Top:
- Date picker (default today)
- Button “Add patient to today” opens a patient search modal

Roster:
Show a list/table of today’s scheduled patients (store schedule locally for now using browser localStorage keyed by date).
Each row shows:
- Patient name
- DOB
- Room (editable input)
- PMH (pulled from patient.get if available; if field missing, show “Not available”)
- Med list (pulled from patient.get if available; if field missing, show “Not available”)
- Ancillaries multi-select dropdown (choose multiple)
- Small status label “Candidate (not ordered)”

Ancillaries dropdown:
- Hardcode the ancillary catalog in code for now as an array of objects:
  { code, name, interval_rule } where interval_rule is "none" | "6mo" | "12mo"
Include at least these example codes: 93880, 93306, 93975, plus a few placeholders.

When ancillaries are selected for a patient:
- For each selected ancillary, check if allowed based on prior history:
  - Use prescreen.list to fetch prior prescreens for that patient and ancillary code.
  - Treat rows where prescreen_status is “Completed” (or if no such column, treat any row with scheduled_datetime in past) as completed history.
  - Determine last completed date and compute next eligible date for 6mo/12mo.
- Display eligibility badge per selected ancillary: Allowed / Allowed after [date]

Row expand:
Clicking a patient row expands it and shows:
- A “Reasoning” section with a text area per selected ancillary (editable)
- A “History” line showing last completed date + next eligible date
- Button “Save candidates”:
    - For each selected ancillary, create or update a prescreen row via API:
      - If prescreen exists already for patient_uuid + code, call prescreen.update with notes/reasoning and scheduled_datetime blank
      - Else call prescreen.create
    - Then call prescreen.updateStatus to set status to “Needs Review”
- Button “Convert to Order” (disabled placeholder)

4) PATIENT PROFILE TAB
- Patient search input using patients.search
- Select patient loads patients.get
- Show demographics + PMH + meds if available
- Show prescreens for that patient using prescreen.list filtered client-side
- Allow editing a selected prescreen using prescreen.get + prescreen.update + prescreen.updateStatus

5) BILLING TAB + FINANCE TAB
Just build placeholders with tables and summary cards (no API wiring yet)

IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Keep it robust if PMH/meds fields do not exist; just show “Not available”
- Use optimistic UI where possible but refresh after saves
- Make sure the app runs immediately in Replit
- Tell me what files you created/modified in client/src

After building, leave API_URL and API_KEY as placeholders for me to paste.
